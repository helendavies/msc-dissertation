TSPs may be found by looking at cells in BM that express things that could allow homing to the thymus. Could it be that in NOD mouse, the expression of this is abherrent and therefore also found on B cell precursors so that XS B cell precursors end up in the thymus???

\begin{itemize}

\item RAG expression decreases as mice age

\end{itemize}
