  abstract = {This paper presents methods for collecting and analyzing physiological
	data during real-world driving tasks to determine a driver's relative
	stress level. Electrocardiogram, electromyogram, skin conductance,
	and respiration were recorded continuously while drivers followed
	a set route through open roads in the greater Boston area. Data from
	24 drives of at least 50-min duration were collected for analysis.
	The data were analyzed in two ways. Analysis I used features from
	5-min intervals of data during the rest, highway, and city driving
	conditions to distinguish three levels of driver stress with an accuracy
	of over 97\% across multiple drivers and driving days. Analysis II
	compared continuous features, calculated at 1-s intervals throughout
	the entire drive, with a metric of observable stressors created by
	independent coders from videotapes. The results show that for most
	drivers studied, skin conductivity and heart rate metrics are most
	closely correlated with driver stress level. These findings indicate
	that physiological signals can provide a metric of driver stress
	in future cars capable of physiological monitoring. Such a metric
	could be used to help manage noncritical in-vehicle information systems
	and could also provide a continuous measure of how different road
	and traffic conditions affect drivers.},

	aim could be to reduce error related risks during task-critical operations
	or to facilitate computer based (e.g. tutoring systems) learning.
	Self reports, task performance, behavioral and physiological changes
	are some of the indicator of CL. However, affective factors which
	occur naturally in everyday life can influence these modalities,
	making CL detecting challenging. In this paper, we investigate machine
	learning techniques for detecting CL levels from task performance
	and physiological channels during affective changes with the support
	of systematic experimental setup. Classification results are presented
	for detecting two levels (low & high) of CL from individual modalities
	and their combination using a vote classifier. We have achieved around
	66% to 78% accuracy for detecting the two CL levels under affective
	changes (valence/arousal).},

	in a flight simulator. Twelve pilots had to fly through a tunnel
	with varying levels of difficulty. Additionally, they had to perform
	a memory task with four levels of difficulty. The easiest memory
	task was combined with the easiest tunnel task and the most difficult
	memory task with the most difficult tunnel task. Between the tunnel
	tasks, subjects had to fly a pursuit task in which a target jet had
	to be followed. Rest periods before and after the experiment were
	used as a baseline for the physiological measures. Mental workload
	was measured with heart period, continuous blood pressure, respiration
	and eye blinks. Several respiratory parameters, heart rate variability,
	blood pressure variability and the gain between systolic blood pressure
	and heart period (modulus) were scored. All measures showed differences
	between rest and flight, and between the pursuit and the tunnel task.
	Only heart period was sens},
