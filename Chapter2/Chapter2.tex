\section{Abnormal B cell presence in the NOD mouse thymus}
\subsection{Thymic B cells}
\todo{thymic B cells are increased in the NOD conpared to nondiabetic controls}

It is normal for B cells to be present in the thymus in small numbers \citep{Isaacson1987, Akashi2000} of non diabetic humans \citep{Isaacson1987} and mice \citep{Akashi2000}. 
However, in the NOD mouse, this population of B cells is dramatically increased \citep{OReilly1994}.
This information has been confirmed by previous work carried out in the laboratory where flow cytometry has been carried out on the thymi of NOD mice and non diabetic control B6 mice.
As shown in \fig{Add figure of JV data}, the presence of B cells in the NOD mouse thymi is significantly increased compared to B6 thymi and the difference between the strains increases as the mice age. (Acknowldegements to Jennifer Varian for provision of raw data). \todo{Explain the graph when it is done!}

\subsubsection{Potential impact of thymic B cells}
\todo{include the fact they are found in other autoimmune diseases too such as MG etc}

Intrathymic B cells in patients with MG \citep{Christensson1998}.

\subsubsection{Potential role of thymic B cells in T1D}
\todo{previous data on autoantibody production and antibody presentation by B cells in T1D}
