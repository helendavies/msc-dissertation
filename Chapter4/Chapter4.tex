\section{B cells are developing in the NOD thymus}

The reason for B cells being present in the thymus is unknown. 
The potential mechanisms, as outlined in \toref{somewhere in background} are B cells developing from progenitors within the thymus or B cells are being released prematurely from the bone marrow and migrating to the thymus where they continue and complete their development.
Data to date suggests that B cells are developing in the thymus due to the fact pro and pre B cells can be seen there. 
However, there are also other methods for investigating potential intrathymic B cell development.
This project focuses on the following areas of investigation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Utilisation of flow cytometry to look for pro and pre B cells in the thymus of NOD mice and to see how the state of the NOD thymus compares with other control mice.\toref{relevant subsection}

\item Utilisation of flow cytometry to look for very early progenitors at the initial stages of B cell commitment within the thymus. 
This required the use of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to deplete thymi of mature cells to reveal the smaller progenitor populations. 
The presence of early B cell progenitors in the thymus could then be compared between NOD mice and controls. \toref{relevant subsection}

\item Utilisation of polymerase chain reaction to investigate the presence of transcription factors and genes driving B cell development in the  thymus. \toref{relevant subsection}
\end{enumerate}

Each will be discussed in the relevant sections below.

\subsection{There are pro and pre B cells present in the NOD thymus}


As mentioned previously, following commitment to the B cell lineage, B cells develop through different developmental stages.
The first is the CD19+CD43+IgM- pro B cell stage.
Following this, IgM heavy chain rearrangement begins and the developing B cells produce an IgM heavy chain. 
They can then progress to the CD19+CD43-IgM- pre B cell stage.
Finally, in the bone marrow, B cells produce a fully functioning B cell receptor (IgM) and are then a CD19+CD43-IgM+ immature B cell.
These immature B cells then move to the spleen to finish their development and become mature B cells.

Interestingly, of the CD19+ cells present in the NOD and B6 mice, although the majority are mature IgM+ B cells, there are also populations of developing B cells at the pro and pre B cell stages.
This gives the impression that B cells are developing within the thymus rather than migrating there and warrants further investigation. \fig{Add figure showing pro and pre B cells}



\subsection{Developing B cells in the thymus express RAG}


To try and identify whether or not pro and pre B cells are developing within the thymus rather than migrating there, the expression of RAG in these developing B cells was investigated.
To do this, a NOD-RAG-GFP reporter mouse was used as this mouse produces GFP when RAG is being expressed.
GFP shows up on flow cytometry therefore it is a useful tool for investigating B cell development.
RAG expression is crucial during B cell development as it allows the rearrangement of the IgM heavy chain and thus allows the progression from pro to pre B cell stage.

Thymi and bone marrow from NOD-RAG-GFP mice of 4, 7 and 11 weeks of age were used for flow cytometry to look for the present of RAG+CD19+ cells.
Positive RAG expression in CD19+IgM- cells would indicate active development.
As shown in \fig{add figure showing RAG high, low, neg in CD19+ cells in thymus}

The intensity of the RAG signal is important for determining the liklihood of active development.
Since GFP is transcribed at the same time as RAG, it initially has a very high intensity.
However, because GFP is a protein it takes a while to degrade and has a half life of ~54hrs.
This means that only the CD19+RAGhigh population can be taken as actively expressing RAG and therefore GFP.
GFPlow cells will have deactivated RAG and therefore the GFP signal will be decaying.
Setting the gates for RAG\textsuperscript{high} and RAG\textsuperscript{low} populations was done by looking at the RAG levels in developing B cells in the bone marrow.

As shown by the \fig{figure of RAG high, low etc} and graph \fig{graph showing RAG high low neg over different ages}, the frequencies of CD19+RAG\textsuperscript{high} \todo{look at how frequencies of CD19+RAG+ cells change with age}. This suggests that... \todo{explanation?}

\fig{\%s of pro and pre in different ages and strains}
\fig{ratios of pro:pre in thymus vs BM. any difference in different strains?}



\subsection{B cell development is dependent on the presence of a mature B cell}

Following on from this finding, B cell KO NOD mice thymi were also investigated.
In these mice, as stated in \toref{wherever I talked about KO mice}, these mice are unable to rearrange their IgM heavy chain and therefore cannot progress beyond the pro B cell stage. 
In the bone marrow of these mice, a population of pro B cells is seen, but there are no pre B cells and no IgM+ cells.
It was therefore expected that in their thymus there would also be a population of pro B cells, similar to that seen in the NOD WT mice. 
However, this does not appear to be the case.
As shown in \fig{add figure showing decreased pro B cells in KO thymi}, it appears that the frequency of pro B cells in the thymus is consistently decreased in B cell KO mice compared to NOD WT mice.
Interestingly, the frequency of IgM-CD43+CD19+ cells in the thymi of KO mice is lower than the frequency seen in the B6 control mouse. 
This gives the impression that a mature B cell is important for allowing the enhancement of pro B cells in the thymus.
Moreover, the need for a mature B cell is more important to increase thymic pro B cells than whatever mechanism is present in the NOD mouse strain that increases the intrathymic pro B cell presence.
The investigation was carried out in a blind trial so that the strains of mice were not known during analysis in order to avoid bias in the results.

\fig{Difference in pro B cells in WT, KO and B6.}
\todo{suggest a transfer experiment/chimera formation to test whether transfer of mature B cells into a KO mouse increases the population of pro B cells in the KO thymus}



\subsection{Early B cell progenitors are present in the NOD thymus}

\subsubsection{Introduction to progenitor work}

Given the discrepency between the NOD mouse and the B6 control mouse in terms of B cell numbers in the thymus, it was decided that investigation into the presence of B cell progenitors in the thymus would be beneficial.
As mentioned in , the progenitor populations giving rise to T and B cells is controversial and there does not appear to be a proven pathway for the development of either.
This leaves a number of questions relating to how these populations can be investigated.
However, literature to date suggests developmental pathways for each and it is this information which has driven the investigation into thymic B cell progenitors.

Of particular interest in this project, information relating to the earliest B cell committed progenitor was sought.
There is much research pertaining to B cell development in the bone marrow and the factors driving the development but it remains a highly complex area.
The matter was complicated further in this project due to the fact B cell development was being investigated in the thymus rather than the bone marrow.
This means that research into this area was based on previous research in the bone marrow and how well B cell development in the bone marrow is mirrored by potential development in the thymus remains unknown.

 However, assuming that B cell development in the thymus was to follow the same pathway as that seen in the bone marrow, the pattern of development should follow the course shown below.

 
\todo{Diagram of B cell development. Show HSCs through MPPs to ALPs/BLPs etc}


 It is not totally clear as to what phenotype the earliest B cell committed progenitor has. 
 However, there is evidence that expression of Ly6D correlates with almost total B cell restriction \toref{Inlay}.
 With this is mind, it was possible to use flow cytometry with an appropriate mix of antibodies to investigate the presence of Ly6D+ progenitors in both the thymus and bone marrow of NOD mouse.
However, Ly6D alone is not sufficient to indicate B cell restriction. 
It is also seen that developing T cells express Ly6D and therefore other markers are required to show which progenitors are likely to B cell restricted rather than T cell restricted.
The markers used alongside Ly6D therefore were Sca-1, c-kit, IL-7Ra and Flt3. 
The reasons for using each of these antibodies are outlined below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Sca-1 - 
\item c-kit - This is expressed at greater levels on T cells compared to B cells therefore in gating of data looking for B cell progenitors, care was taken to not include c-kit high cells as these are likely to B of T cell lineage \toref{Find a reference for this} 
\item IL-7Ra - 
\item Flt3 - The expression of Flt3 on progenitors denotes the retention of B and T cell lineage potential. Therefore, when looking for progenitors that have the potenital to become either a T or B cell, the expression of Flt3 shows that it is not yet committed to the T cell lineage.
\toref{Karsunky2008}
\item Ly6D - \toref{Inlay, Mansson, Zhang2013}
\end{itemize}




The thymus is the site of T cell development and education.
The progenitors for T cells, however, are not totally understood. 
There is belief that T cells originate from CLPs which have migrated from the bone marrow to the thymus where they receive the correct signals which cause them to differentiate into T cells
\subsection{Magnetic-assisted cell sorting optimisation}

Due to the small size of progenitor populations in comparison to mature cell populations in the thymus, it was first necessary to deplete the thymus of the majority of mature cells before looking for progenitors.
For depletion, magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) was used.
There are many different kits available and the decision on which to use for the experiments was taken after investigating the efficiency and yield from Miltenyi beads and columnms, and Qiagen anti-rat beads \todo{name of Qiagen beads}

Firstly, Miltenyi columns and lineage depletion beads were tested to assess their efficiency. 
\fig{add figure showing efficiency of beads/columns here}.
To start with, only one round of depletion was carried out which gave an efficiency of \todo{look at efficiencies}.
This efficiency was improved to \todo{add efficiency of 2 rounds} when two rounds of depletion were carried out \fig{2 round miltenyi lineage depletion}. 
\begin{figure}
	\begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}

	\end{subfigure}
	
\caption{Figure showing the different methods of depletion. Qiagen beads in shows that 89\% percent of cells are CD4-CD8-}
\end{figure}
However, while this method gave a very pure sample with very few mature cells remaining, the yield was not very good.

Since the point of the depletion was just to reduce the quantity of mature cells so that the progenitor populations could be seen by flow cytometry, it was more important for the experiment that there was a lot of cells to interrogate rather than them being very pure.
Therefore, Qiagen beads were tried and as shown, \fig{figure of Qiagen depletion}, while the purity was not as good as the Miltenyi beads \todo{efficiency of Qiagen beads}, the yield was much improved.
This was a better balance for the experiment, therefore, Qiagen beads were used.
\todo{insert a table showing the efficiencies of each depletion method}

\todo{analyse results comparing NOD/KO/B6 data to see if the presence of BLPs is normal in NOD}
Once the method of lineage depletion was decided on, it was then possible to move forward to investigating the early progenitor populations in NOD, NOD KO and B6 thymi.
BLP presence was of particular interest as differences in populations between strains of mice could suggest whether the increase in B cells in the NOD thymus was as a result of processes before or after this point.
BLPs are thought to be the first cell committed to the B cell lineage therefore if the populations of these cells are different, it could suggest abnormalities in factors driving B cell commitment.

\todo{analyse data to see whether it is normal or abnormal. This is a good control to give an indication of the overall condition of the thymus, preferably over time to see how it changes as mouse ages with normal physiological atrophy of the thymus}

\subsection{The NOD thymus contains B cell development transcription factors}

If B cells are developing within the thymus, this begs the question as to whether the NOD thymus is providing an environment more conducive to B cell development compared to nondiabetic controls. 
To invesitgate this, primers were designed that were specific for B cell development factors such as E2A, EBF, Pax5, VPreB and CXCL12.
\todo{look in Hagman2006, Welinder2011, Mansson2008, Cobaleda2007, Radtke2013, Riley2013, Tokoyoda2004 for TF info}.

To date, only regular PCR has been carried out to compare whether or not B cell development transcription factors are present in the NOD bone marrow and thymus.
Since normal B cell development occurs in the bone marrow, these transcription factors would be expected there and indeed they were seen there, as shown in \fig{TF gels}. 
Interestingly, all the genes, besides CXCL12, were also present in the NOD thymus too.
This indicates that the thymic environment may also be allowing B cell development.
The lack of CXCL12 in the thymus is not a surprising result as it is a cytokine responsible for holding developing B cells in the bone marrow niche and therefore, may be more bone marrow specific rather than B cell specific.

\subsection{Conclusion}

Data to date has so far given evidence that B cells are developing intrathymically in the NOD mouse.
This is shown by pro and pre B cells being present suggesting that developing B cells are present in the thymus.
Further to this, some of these cells show evidence of active RAG expression, indicating that they are actively developing within the thymus rather than having migrated there following premature release from the bone marrow.

There is also evidence to suggest that B lineage committed early progenitors, such as BLPs, are present within the NOD thymus. 
This also gives the impression that B cells are developing from progenitors within the thymus as these are believed to be the progenitors that pro B cells are derived from.
\todo{Add conclusion on differences in frequencies of BLPs in NOD/B6/KO etc to see if any difference}

Finally, it appears that the NOD thymus may be providing factors that are allowing, if not driving, B cell development.
However, it remains to be seen whether this is a normal finding in nondiabetic controls also.
It would also be useful to carry out quantitative PCR of B cell development factors to see the relative levels between the thymus and bone marrow and across strains of mice.
This could suggest whether or not it may be a thymic abnormality in the NOD mouse which is providing a particularly good environment for B cell development compared to other strains of mice.

\section{Some RAG+ cells in the thymus express B and T cell markers}
During analysis of data from previous experiments, it was noted that a large proportion of RAG+CD19+ cells in the NOD thymus, were also CD4+CD8+.
This was of interest and was therefore investigated further as it indicated there is a possibility for cells with markers of both T and B cells.

\subsection{A large proportion of RAG+CD19+ cells in the NOD thymus express CD4 and CD8}

\cref{fig:RAGCD19CD4CD8pos}

RAG acitvation occurs both in developing T and B cells.
It's activation allows the rearrangement of either the T cell receptor (TcR) in T cells or the B cell receptor (IgM).
Flow cytometry of NOD-RAG-GFP reporter mice thymi therefore reveals the RAG activation status indirectly via the production of GFP.
How recently the RAG was activated in a cell can be indicated by the intensity of the GFP signal as GFP degrades over time.
This means that active transcription of RAG/GFP will have a very bright signal, whereas cells which have deactivated RAG will have diminishing levels of GFP and therefore the signal will be less bright.

Interestingly, whilst interrogating NOD thymi for the presence of CD19+RAG+ cells, it was noted that of these cells, a large percentage of them were also CD4+CD8+.
This was an interesting finding as it suggests there may be a point where cells are not yet fully lineage committed and are expressing markers of both T (CD4, CD8) and B (CD19) cells.
These cells all have a high GFP signal and therefore are actively transcribing the protein, indicating that RAG is also active.
This suggests that these cells are expressing markers of both T and B cells as well as rearranging a receptor.

Unfortunately, due to lack of control mice of the correct age, it is not possible to say whether or not this is a normal pysiological process seen in nondiabetic control mice as well as NOD mice or whether it is unique to the NOD.
However, due to normal B cell development occurring in the bone marrow, the thymus and bone marrow were compared for presence of RAG+CD19+CD4+CD8+ cells.
As shown in \fig{figure of BM lack of RAGCD19CD4CD8 pos cells}, none of these cells were seen in the bone marrow. 
This gives the impression that they are not a normal part of B cell development.

This finding could suggest an alternative mechanism by which B cells are increased in the NOD thymus, and that is that a cell is beginning to commit to the T cell lineage, then at some point receiving a signal which is causing it to begin to switch lineages and start expressing B cell markers.
This potential redifferentiation could explain the existence of both B and T cell markers on the cells. 
However, further research would be required to explore this further. \todo{think of expt}.

The gating pattern used to look for these cells in the thymus and bone marrow of NOD WT and NOD KO is shown in \cref{fig:RAGposDP}.
However, it was not known if this is normal during B cell development, therefore the bone marrow was used as a comparison to see if these cells existed there too, where B cells develop normally.
Interestingly, there were no RAG+CD19+CD4+CD8+ cells seen in the bone marrow at all. 
The comparison between a representative 4 week old NOD thymus and bone marrow is shown in \cref{subfig:BMvsThyRAGCD19DP}.
The presence of these RAG+CD19+CD4+CD8+ cells in the thymus was consistent and seen in 4 week and 7 week old NOD thymi with group sizes of 4 or 5 mice in each age group. 
The lack of these cells in the bone marrow suggests that they may be thymus-specific.
However, whether or not the presence of these cells has any relation to the increased population of thymic B cells seen in the NOD mouse remains to be determined.
One way of investigating this is to use non diabetic, control B6 mice.


These cells are present in NOD mice at both 4 and 7 weeks of age and it was therefore investigated whether or not there was a significant difference in the percentages of these cells between the two age groups. 
The bone marrow is also included in the figure as a comparison.
The results of this comparison are shown in \fig{add a graph showing how the ages affect the presence of RAG+CD19+DP cells in the thymus and bone marrow}
\todo{add some data/graph/statistics to show significance, whether there is a difference between the ages etc}

\subsection{RAG+IgM+TcRb+ cell presence in the NOD thymus}

It was then also investigated as to whether the developing cells expressing RAG, CD19, CD4 and CD8 could potentially progress to being RAG+CD19+IgM+TcR+ and therefore express mature T and B cell markers.
Data for this is shown in figure \cref{fig:RAGIgMTcRpos}

\label{fig:RAGIgMTcRpos}
\end{figure}

\subsection{IgM+TcRb+ cell presence}

Whether or not there are mature cells present in other tissues in the body that are expressing TcR and IgM was then explored.
To do this, flow cytometry was carried out on thymic samples from NOD, NOD KO and B6 mice using antibodies specific to TcRb and IgM.
This time, the spleen was also investigated alongside the thymus and bone marrow to provide another comparison and to widen the search for IgM+TcR+ cells irrelevant of RAG expression.
Mice of various different ages were investigated and the results are shown in \fig{figure showing TcR+IgM+ cells (or not!)} .
Isotype controls were also carried out to help with determining whether cells were expressing TcR or IgM or not.
The data from the isotype controls in shown in \fig{isotype controls}.
\todo{include isotype control data}


\subsection{Conclusion}
Following on from the flow cytometric data acquired so far relating to the presence of IgM+TcR+ cells in the NOD thymus, it appears that these cells do not exist. 
It may be that the RAG+CD19+CD4+CD8+ cells seen in the thymus are early cells developing in the thymus which are not yet totally committed to one lineage and are expressing markers of multiple lineages, hence the T and B cell markers.
However, it would be beneficial to carry out investigation at the protein level, for example, Western Blotting, in order to see if more mature cells are expressing T and B cell receptors.




\section{Potential contribution of thymic B cells to T1D}

\subsection{Pilot study to track movement/homing of thymic B cells on transfer into recipient mice}

\todo{where B cells traffic to could give indication of their role in T1D. Also, use of GFP as  a marker. However, numbers were very small so analysis difficult. Needs to be done again in the future. Comment on whether it may be possible and what would need to change to make it work. Also decide on which transfer experiment I am referring to.. NOD to KO or GFP to NOD...}

As little is known about the function of thymic B cells, a pilot study was set up with the aim of investigating the migration/homing abilities of thymic cells, including B cells when injected intravenously into recipient mice.
The aims of the experiments were to see whether B cells and their progenitors derived from a donor NOD thymus had a preference for migrating back to the thymus following injection or whether they went elsewhere.
By understanding the movements of thymic B cells and their preferential home tissues, it may give an indication as to what, if any, their contribution is to T1D pathogenesis.

\fig{Showing the set up of expt} shows how the experiments were conducted. 
Two donor thymi were taken and split into CD19+ and CD19- fractions using MACS.
CD19+ fractions from both donor were then pooled and the same was done for the CD19- fractions.
Four recipient mice were then injected with either CD19+ or CD19- thymic cells from the donors.
After specified time points, the recipient mice were sacrificed and their tissues were analysed.
The tissues taken for analysis were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Thymus - The origin of the donor cells. It was analysed in the recipient to see if the donor cells would migrate to the recipient thymus giving the impression that thymic B cells have specific properties which allow them to traffic back to the thymus.
For example, they may have specific cytokine sensitivity which results in being able to home back to the thymus, even following intravenous transfer.
\item Spleen - The spleen was included for analysis as this is the normal site of B cell maturation.
Therefore it was of interest to see if thymic derived donor cells would move here like conventional B cells do to finish development.
\item Bone marrow - The bone marrow is the normal site of B cell development and therefore was included to see if the developing donor B cells would preferentially migrate here to develop in the same way as conventional B cells
\item Pancreas - The pancreas contains the Islets of Langerhans which are destroyed in T1D through T and B cell mediated attack.
It is the site of infiltration therefore it was included in analysis to see if thymic B cells were part of the infiltration process.
If so, it may indicate that thymic B cells could have a direct role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
\item Pancreatic lymph node - The PLN is where antigen-presenting cells move to from the pancreas in order to activate T cells.
In T1D, APCs move from the pancreatic islets to the PLN carrying islet antigens and therefore the PLN is in an inflammatory state.
This tissue was therefore included to look at the status of the lymph node to compare it to the control axillary lymph node.
\item Lateral axillary lymph node - This tissue was analysed as a control to compare to the PLN.
Whereas the PLN should be inflamed in T1D, the lateral axillary lymph node should not and can therefore show that any inflammation in the PLN is localised and is not as a result of inflammation throughout the body.
\end{itemize}



\todo{Questions to ask of data: 1) Where do B cells go? 2)Do the B cells survive? 3) Is GFP a good tracker? 4) Do you get B cells in the CD19- recipients? 5) DO CD19+ cells increase in KOs after transfer? Can't tell as can't differentiate between donor and recipient) 6) Is there new GFP activation after transfer?}

\subsubsection{NOD-RAG-GFP donor thymic cells, NOD WT recipients}

The aim of this experiment was to see where development of B cells occurs in the recipient cells and to see whether or not the presence/absence of CD19+ cells has on the ability of early CD19- progenitor B cells to develop.
It was also an opportunity to see whether GFP is a useful tool for tracking transferred cells or whether the half life is not long enough to track transferred cells for a useful amount of time in the recipient.

\paragraph{Are there any GFP+ cells seen in the recipients?}

Analysis of the recipient mice at both 4 and 7 days post transfer revealed that there are GFP+ cells seen in the recipient mice at both time points.
In particular, GFP+ cells at both time points seem to migrate to the bone marrow, spleen and control lymph node. 
Some cells migrate to the thymus but only in the CD19- recipients and the population seen there is of very low frequency.

Analysis was mainly concerned with GFP+CD19+IgM+ cell presence.
These cells were looked for in each of the recipient tissues mentioned above.
However, only some tissues seemed to differ significantly from the control and these were the spleen, thymus and bone marrow.
All the other tissues appeared to be very similar to the control NOD mouse included for analysis.

Bone Marrow

4 days:
In this tissue, the presence of CD19+ cells is increased in the CD19+ recipient and the CD19- recipient in comparison to the NOD WT control.
This increase is further accentuated in the CD19+ recipient.
This could suggest that transferred CD19+ cells are moving to the bone marrow.
Contaminating CD19+ cells in the CD19- fraction could account for the small increase in CD19+ population in the CD19- recipient.
However, in terms of GFP presence, it seems that the levels of GFP in the B cells is negligable compared to the control WT NOD mouse.
This suggests that the trasferred cells that may be increasing the CD19+ populations in the bone marrow are mature prior to entering the recipient bone marrow, shown by the lack of GFP.

There are also no more CD19+RAG+ cells in the recipient mice compared to the control mice suggesting that there are no actively developing transferred B cells in the bone marrow.
This could indicate that either B cells are not able to develop following transfer or that they are not doing so in the bone marrow 4 days post transfer.

7 days:
After 7 days, CD19+ cells are increased in both recipients. 
Unlike at 4 days, the increase is similar in both recipients.
GFP is also increased compared to the NOD control.

Spleen

4 days:
In this tissue, a similar picture is seen compared to the bone marrow. 
Again, CD19+ cells are increased in both the recipients compared to the NOD control but the GFP is only slightly increased, if at all.

7 days:
Again at 7 days, the frequency of CD19+RAG+ cells is increased, though the frequency of RAG+ cells in this population is not increased compared to the control.


Thymus

4 days:
In this tissue the frequency of CD19+ cells is increased in the CD19- recipient and decreased in the CD19+ recipient.
There is more GFP in both recipients than the NOD but the most is in the CD19+ recipient.

7 days:
Very similar picture to the 4 day time point.
However, the frequency of B cells is similar in both recipients and both similar/lower than the frequency in the control.
The levels of GFP are increased though in both recipients.


The pancreas, control and pancreatic LNs showed no difference to the control NOD mouse suggesting that they were affected very little by the transferred cells. 
The only difference was an increase in B cells in the control lymph node at the 7 day time point, but no increase in GFP+ cells.



Bone marrow 


CD19+ recipients had GFP+ cells at both 4 (0.128\%) and 7 (0.345\%) day time points. There were more at the 7 day time points. Both only had RAG low cells, no RAG high populations.
At 4 days, 60\% were CD19+ and of these, ~60\% were IgM+.
At 7 days, 85\% were CD19+ and of these, ~7\% were IgM+
The lack of any RAG high cells suggests that no transferred B cell progenitors are preferentially moving to the BM to develop.

Cd19- recipients appeared to have GFP+ cells at both the 4 (0.149\%) and 7 (0.274\%) day time points. If anything, there is a bigger frequency of GFP+ cells at 7 days PT.
However, at 4 days there are 2 populations, one that is RAG high which consists of CD19- cells, and a larger one that is RAG low, of which ~60\% are CD19+, of which ~50\% are IgM+.
At 7 days there were no RAG high cells, just a population of RAG low cells of which ~77\% were CD19+ and of these, only 29\% were IgM+.
This gives the impression that very little RAG activity is occurring following transfer as there are no RAG high cells after 7 days.
This suggests that any B cell progenitors that were transferred into the recipients have not started rearranging their BcR there.
Any RAGlow CD19+ cells have already rearranged their receptors prior to this time point which accounts for the low RAG level.

Both recipients had GFP, more at 7 days.
GFP low cells - 4d both ~60\% CD19+ and then ~50-60\% IgM+. 
		 		7dCD19+ 85\% CD19+, 7\% IgM+.
		 		7dCD19- ~77\% Cd19+, 29\% IgM+
		 		7 day CD19- recipient also had RAG high population but were CD19-.
		 		
At both time points, both recipients looked similar in terms of RAG+ frequency. 
At 4 days, both recipients looked very similar with similar frequencies of CD19+ and IgM+ cells too. 
At 7 days, the frequency of RAG+CD19+ cells are similar but the frequency of IgM+ cells is much reduced at the 7 day time point in the CD19+ recipients.


Spleen

In CD19+ recipients there are GFP+ cells at both 4 (0.113) and 7 (0.292) days. The RAG intensity is medium. 
At 4 days, at the higher levels of RAG, there are no CD19+ cells.
In the RAG low population, about 45\% is CD19+ and of these, ~66\% are IgM+.
AT 7 days, about 74\% are CD19+ and of these, ~85\% are IgM+.
IgM+ RAG low cells are likely to be those cells that have rearranged prior to transfer...

CD19- recipients. 
Substantial GFP at 4 (0.739) and 7 (0.690) day time points. 
RAG is medium/low intensity
At 4 days, of GFP+ only ~10\% are CD19+, of these 66\% are IgM+
At 7 days, of GFP+, ~10\% are CD19+, of these 67\% are IgM+

Lower frequencies of GFP+CD19+ cells in CD19- recipients.
In CD19+ recipients, CD19+ cells are at a bigger frequency at 7 days compared to 4 days.
Similar frequencies of IgM+ cells amongst CD19+ cells in all except 7day CD19+ recipients


Thymus 

CD19+ recipient: No GFP+CD19+ cells in CD19+ recipient at 4 or 7 days days PT (no difference to WT control).
Robust population of GFP+ cells seen but these are T cells.

CD19+ recipient has no GFP+ cells at 4 days.
At 7 days there is a population of RAG high cells (0.248\%) of which only ~7\% are CD19+. 
The rest are DP T cells.

CD19- recipient: None seen. Very few GFP+ cells at all.

CD19- recipients have some (0.051-0.081\%) GFP+ cells - very few.
At 4 days, all are CD19-
At 7 days ~50\% are CD19+, all IgM-.
However, when do whole thymus CD19 vs SS, it appears there are 3 populations. One larger CD19-, a CD19 low and CD19+.


PLN

CD19+ recipient: No GFP+ cells at all

CD19- recipient: No GFP+ cells are in WT, 4 days or RAG control. 
Some GFP+ cells (0.525\%) at 7 days. More than RAG control which suggests any cells there are transferred. All are CD19-.

axLN

CD19+ recipient: GFP at 4 (0.077) and 7 (0.067) days
At 4 days all are CD19-
At 7 days ~50\% are CD19+. However so few cells...

CD19- recipients have GFP at 4 (0.77) and 7 (0.530) days. 
Intensity high at 4 days.
4 days all are CD19-
7 days all are CD19-

Pancreas

CD19+ recipient: Some GFP+CD19+ cells at 4 days but none at 7 days. 
Low GFP expression.
Think they are all CD4+ T cells.

CD19+ recipients. GFP at 4 days 0.408\%. Very few, if any 0.054\% at 7 days.
4 days 54\% are Cd19+ are then 70\% are IgM+
7 days too few cells.

CD19- recipient: Possibly some GFP+CD19+ cells in 4 day but not 7day PT. Very few.
Very small amount of GFP at each time point.
At 4 days, ~50\% are CD19+ (but on 31 counts)
At 7 days, too few cells


However, due to the very small scale of the experiment, the results need to be viewed with caution.
Further repeats on a larger scale would need to be carried out to increase the validity of the results.

\subsubsection{NOD WT donor thymic cells, NOD KO recipients}

The aim of this experiment was to see if transferred B cells would be able to survive in the recipient KO mice.
\citet{Serreze1998} has carried out a similar experiment in the past whereby NOD B cells were transferred into KO recipient mice.
This experiment showed that the transferred B cells disappeared in the recipients between 6 and 15 days post transfer.
It was suggested that the B cells were killed of by CTLs which had not developed tolerance to B cells having never been exposed to them.
However, there is a major difference between previous experiments and mine, and that is that I used thymic B cells rather than splenic B cells.
Since thymic B cells are not well understood, it was therefore thought that their ability to survive following transfer may be different to that of splenic B cells.
