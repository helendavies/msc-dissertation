\section{B cells are developing in the NOD thymus}

The reason for B cells being present in the thymus is unknown. 
The potential mechanisms, as outlined in \toref{somewhere in background} are B cells developing from progenitors within the thymus or B cells are being released prematurely from the bone marrow and migrating to the thymus where they continue and complete their development.
Data to date suggests that B cells are developing in the thymus due to the fact pro and pre B cells can be seen there. 
However, there are also other methods for investigating potential intrathymic B cell development.
This project focuses on the following areas of investigation:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Utilisation of flow cytometry to look for pro and pre B cells in the thymus of NOD mice and to see how the state of the NOD thymus compares with other control mice.\toref{relevant subsection}

\item Utilisation of flow cytometry to look for very early progenitors at the initial stages of B cell commitment within the thymus. 
This required the use of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to deplete thymi of mature cells to reveal the smaller progenitor populations. 
The presence of early B cell progenitors in the thymus could then be compared between NOD mice and controls. \toref{relevant subsection}

\item Utilisation of polymerase chain reaction to investigate the presence of transcription factors and genes driving B cell development in the  thymus. \toref{relevant subsection}
\end{enumerate}

Each will be discussed in the relevant sections below.

\subsection{There are pro and pre B cells present in the NOD thymus}

Interestingly, of the CD19+ cells present in the NOD and B6 mice, although the majority are mature IgM+ B cells, there are also populations of developing B cells at the pro and pre B cell stages.
This gives the impression that B cells are developing within the thymus rather than solely migrating there in the mature state. \fig{Add figure showing pro and pre B cells}

Following on from this finding, B cell KO NOD mice thymi were also investigated.
In these mice, as stated in \toref{wherever I talked about KO mice}, these mice are unable to rearrange their IgM heavy chain and therefore cannot progress beyond the pro B cell stage. 
In the bone marrow of these mice, a population of pro B cells is seen, but there are no pre B cells and no IgM+ cells.
It was therefore expected that in their thymus there would also be a population of pro B cells, similar to that seen in the NOD WT mice. 
However, this does not appear to be the case.
As shown in \fig{add figure showing decreased pro B cells in KO thymi}, it appears that the frequency of pro B cells in the thymus is consistently decreased in B cell KO mice compared to NOD WT mice.
Interestingly, the frequency of IgM-CD43+CD19+ cells in the thymi of KO mice is lower than the frequency seen in the B6 control mouse. 
This gives the impression that a mature B cell is important for allowing the enhancement of pro B cells in the thymus.
Moreover, the need for a mature B cell is more important to increase thymic pro B cells than whatever mechanism is present in the NOD mouse strain that increases the intrathymic pro B cell presence.
The investigation was carried out in a blind trial so that the strains of mice were not known during analysis in order to avoid bias in the results.



\subsection{Magnetic-assisted cell sorting optimisation}

Due to the small size of progenitor populations in comparison to mature cell populations in the thymus, it was first necessary to deplete the thymus of the majority of mature cells before looking for progenitors.
For depletion, magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) was used.
There are many different kits available and the decision on which to use for the experiments was taken after investigating the efficiency and yield from Miltenyi beads and columnms, and Qiagen anti-rat beads \todo{name of Qiagen beads}

Firstly, Miltenyi columns and lineage depletion beads were tested to assess their efficiency. 
\fig{add figure showing efficiency of beads/columns here}.
To start with, only one round of depletion was carried out which gave an efficiency of \todo{look at efficiencies}.
This efficiency was improved to \todo{add efficiency of 2 rounds} when two rounds of depletion were carried out \fig{2 round miltenyi lineage depletion}. 
\begin{figure}

\caption{Figure showing the different methods of depletion. Qiagen beads in shows that 89\% percent of cells are CD4-CD8-}
\end{figure}
However, while this method gave a very pure sample with very few mature cells remaining, the yield was not very good.

Since the point of the depletion was just to reduce the quantity of mature cells so that the progenitor populations could be seen by flow cytometry, it was more important for the experiment that there was a lot of cells to interrogate rather than them being very pure.
Therefore, Qiagen beads were tried and as shown, \fig{figure of Qiagen depletion}, while the purity was not as good as the Miltenyi beads \todo{efficiency of Qiagen beads}, the yield was much improved.
This was a better balance for the experiment, therefore, Qiagen beads were used.

\subsection{Early B cell progenitors are present in the NOD thymus}

\subsubsection{Introduction to progenitor work}

Given the discrepency between the NOD mouse and the B6 control mouse in terms of B cell numbers in the thymus, it was decided that investigation into the presence of B cell progenitors in the thymus would be beneficial.
As mentioned in , the progenitor populations giving rise to T and B cells is controversial and there does not appear to be a proven pathway for the development of either.
This leaves a number of questions relating to how these populations can be investigated.
However, literature to date suggests developmental pathways for each and it is this information which has driven the investigation into thymic B cell progenitors.

Of particular interest in this project, information relating to the earliest B cell committed progenitor was sought.
There is much research pertaining to B cell development in the bone marrow and the factors driving the development but it remains a highly complex area.
The matter was complicated further in this project due to the fact B cell development was being investigated in the thymus rather than the bone marrow.
This means that research into this area was based on previous research in the bone marrow and how well B cell development in the bone marrow is mirrored by potential development in the thymus remains unknown.

 However, assuming that B cell development in the thymus was to follow the same pathway as that seen in the bone marrow, the pattern of development should follow the course shown below.
 
\todo{Diagram of B cell development. Show HSCs through MPPs to ALPs/BLPs etc}


 It is not totally clear as to what phenotype the earliest B cell committed progenitor has. 
 However, there is evidence that expression of Ly6D correlates with almost total B cell restriction \toref{Inlay}.
 With this is mind, it was possible to use flow cytometry with an appropriate mix of antibodies to investigate the presence of Ly6D+ progenitors in both the thymus and bone marrow of NOD mouse.
However, Ly6D alone is not sufficient to indicate B cell restriction. 
It is also seen that developing T cells express Ly6D and therefore other markers are required to show which progenitors are likely to B cell restricted rather than T cell restricted.
The markers used alongside Ly6D therefore were Sca-1, c-kit, IL-7Ra and Flt3. 
The reasons for using each of these antibodies are outlined below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Sca-1 - 
\item c-kit - This is expressed at greater levels on T cells compared to B cells therefore in gating of data looking for B cell progenitors, care was taken to not include c-kit high cells as these are likely to B of T cell lineage \toref{Find a reference for this} 
\item IL-7Ra - 
\item Flt3 - The expression of Flt3 on progenitors denotes the retention of B and T cell lineage potential. Therefore, when looking for progenitors that have the potenital to become either a T or B cell, the expression of Flt3 shows that it is not yet committed to the T cell lineage.
\toref{Karsunky2008}
\item Ly6D - \toref{Inlay, Mansson, Zhang2013}
\end{itemize}




The thymus is the site of T cell development and education.
The progenitors for T cells, however, are not totally understood. 
There is belief that T cells originate from CLPs which have migrated from the bone marrow to the thymus where they receive the correct signals which cause them to differentiate into T cells

\todo{analyse results comparing NOD/KO/B6 data to see if the presence of BLPs is normal in NOD}
Once the method of lineage depletion was decided on, it was then possible to move forward to investigating the early progenitor populations in NOD, NOD KO and B6 thymi.
BLP presence was of particular interest as differences in populations between strains of mice could suggest whether the increase in B cells in the NOD thymus was as a result of processes before or after this point.
BLPs are thought to be the first cell committed to the B cell lineage therefore if the populations of these cells are different, it could suggest abnormalities in factors driving B cell commitment.

\subsection{Conclusion}




\section{Some RAG+ cells in the thymus express B and T cell markers}
During analysis of data from previous experiments, it was noted that a large proportion of RAG+CD19+ cells in the NOD thymus, were also CD4+CD8+.
This was of interest and was therefore investigated further.

\subsection{A large proportion of RAG+CD19+ cells in the NOD thymus express CD4 and CD8}

\cref{fig:RAGCD19CD4CD8pos}

Whilst looking for RAG+CD19+ developing B cells in the NOD thymus, analysis of these cells showed that they were also expressing CD4 and CD8. 
This suggests that there are cells developing in the thymus, shown by the expression of RAG, that are not yet lineage committed and are expressing markers of both T and B cells.
It could suggest that there is a mechanism by which T cells are becoming B cells or vice versa.
The gating pattern used to look for these cells in the thymus and bone marrow of NOD WT and NOD KO is shown in \cref{fig:RAGposDP}.
However, it was not known if this is normal during B cell development, therefore the bone marrow was used as a comparison to see if these cells existed there too, where B cells develop normally.
Interestingly, there were no RAG+CD19+CD4+CD8+ cells seen in the bone marrow at all. 
The comparison between a representative 4 week old NOD thymus and bone marrow is shown in \cref{subfig:BMvsThyRAGCD19DP}.
The presence of these RAG+CD19+CD4+CD8+ cells in the thymus was consistent and seen in 4 week and 7 week old NOD thymi with group sizes of 4 or 5 mice in each age group. 
The lack of these cells in the bone marrow suggests that they may be thymus-specific.
However, whether or not the presence of these cells has any relation to the increased population of thymic B cells seen in the NOD mouse remains to be determined.
One way of investigating this is to use non diabetic, control B6 mice.


These cells are present in NOD mice at both 4 and 7 weeks of age and it was therefore investigated whether or not there was a significant difference in the percentages of these cells between the two age groups. 
The bone marrow is also included in the figure as a comparison.
The results of this comparison are shown in \fig{add a graph showing how the ages affect the presence of RAG+CD19+DP cells in the thymus and bone marrow}
\todo{add some data/graph/statistics to show significance, whether there is a difference between the ages etc}

\subsection{RAG+IgM+TcRb+ cell presence in the NOD thymus}
It was then also investigated as to whether the developing cells expressing RAG, CD19, CD4 and CD8 could potentially progress to being RAG+CD19+IgM+TcR+ and therefore express mature T and B cell markers.
Data for this is shown in figure \cref{fig:RAGIgMTcRpos}

\label{fig:RAGIgMTcRpos}
\end{figure}

\subsection{IgM+TcRb+ cell presence}
Following on from this, the aim was to see if these cells develop further and begin to express both a T and B cell receptor, in this case, TcRb and IgM.
To do this, flow cytometry was carried out on thymic samples from NOD, NOD KO and B6 mice using antibodies specific to TcRb and IgM.
This time, the spleen was also investigated alongside the thymus and bone marrow to provide another comparison and to widen the search for IgM+TcR+ cells.
Mice of various different ages were investigated and the results are shown in \fig{figure showing TcR+IgM+ cells (or not!)} .
Isotype controls were also carried out to help with determining whether cells were expressing TcR or IgM or not.
The data from the isotype controls in shown in \fig{isotype controls}.
\todo{include isotype control data}


\subsection{Conclusion}
Following on from the flow cytometric data acquired so far relating to the presence of IgM+TcR+ cells in the NOD thymus, it appears that these cells do not exist. 
It may be that the RAG+CD19+CD4+CD8+ cells seen in the thymus are early cells developing in the thymus which are not yet totally committed to one lineage and are expressing markers of multiple lineages, hence the T and B cell markers.
However, it would be beneficial to carry out investigation at the protein level, for example, Western Blotting, in order to see if more mature cells are expressing T and B cell receptors.




\section{Potential contribution of thymic B cells to T1D}

\subsection{Pilot study to track movement/homing of thymic B cells on transfer into recipient mice}
\todo{where B cells traffic to could give indication of their role in T1D. Also, use of GFP as  a marker. However, numbers were very small so analysis difficult. Needs to be done again in the future. Comment on whether it may be possible and what would need to change to make it work. Also decide on which transfer experiment I am referring to.. NOD to KO or GFP to NOD...}
In order to look at the potential impact that thymic B cells may be having on the pathogenesis of T1D, a pilot study looking at the migration of donor thymic B cells following intravenous injection into recipient mice was set up. 
At time points of 7 and 11 days post injection, recipient mice were sacrificed and their thymus, spleen, bone marrow, pancreas, pancreatic lymph node and lateral axillary lymph node were all analysed by flow cytometry.
The tissues to analyse were chosen for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item Thymus - The thymus is the tissue where the donor cells were taken therefore it was included in analysis to see if the donor cells would migrate back to the thymus in the recipient cells.
This would give the impression that thymic B cells have specific properties which allow them to traffic back to the thymus.
For example, they may have specific cytokine sensitivity which results in being able to home back to the thymus following transfer.
\item Spleen - The spleen was included for analysis as this is the normal site of B cell maturation.
Therefore it was of interest to see if thymic derived donor cells would move here like conventional B cells do to finish development.
\item Bone marrow - The bone marrow is the normal site of B cell development and therefore was included to see if the developing donor B cells would preferentially to here to develop in the same way as conventional B cells
\item Pancreas - The pancreas contains the Islets of Langerhans which are destroyed in T1D through T and B cell mediated attack.
Pancreatic tissue was therefore analysed to see if thymic B cells migrate to here preferentially upon transfer into recipient mice.
If so, it may indicate that thymic B cells could have a direct role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
\item Pancreatic lymph node - The PLN is where antigen-presenting cells move to from the pancreas in order to activate T cells.
In T1D, APCs move from the pancreatic islets to the PLN carrying islet antigens and therefore the PLN is in an inflammatory state.
This tissue was therefore included to look at the status of the lymph node to compare it to the control axillary lymph node.
\item Lateral axillary lymph node - This tissue was analysed as a control to compare to the PLN.
Whereas the PLN should be inflamed in T1D, the lateral axillary lymph node should not and can therefore show that any inflammation in the PLN is localised and is not as a result of inflammation throughout the body.
\end{itemize}

\todo{Questions to ask of data: 1) Where do B cells go? 2)Do the B cells survive? 3) Is GFP a good tracker? 4) Do you get B cells in the CD19- recipients? 5) DO CD19+ cells increase in KOs after transfer? Can't tell as can't differentiate between donor and recipient) 6) Is there new GFP activation after transfer?}
